# Zane's CFB Analytics Projects

This repo contains several python files, ipython notebooks, and other files that I'm using in college football analytics projects.

[Initial aPPD (adjusted points per drive) writeup and discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/9oz4t5/introducing_adjusted_points_per_drive_a_new/)
